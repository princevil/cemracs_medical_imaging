'fminunc' is a function from the file /Applications/Octave.app/Contents/Resources/usr/Cellar/octave/4.0.3/share/octave/4.0.3/m/optimization/fminunc.m

 -- Function File: fminunc (FCN, X0)
 -- Function File: fminunc (FCN, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- Function File: [X, FVAL, INFO, OUTPUT, GRAD, HESS] = fminunc (FCN,
          ...)
     Solve an unconstrained optimization problem defined by the function
     FCN.

     FCN should accept a vector (array) defining the unknown variables,
     and return the objective function value, optionally with gradient.
     'fminunc' attempts to determine a vector X such that 'FCN (X)' is a
     local minimum.

     X0 determines a starting guess.  The shape of X0 is preserved in
     all calls to FCN, but otherwise is treated as a column vector.

     OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional options.  Currently,
     'fminunc' recognizes these options: "FunValCheck", "OutputFcn",
     "TolX", "TolFun", "MaxIter", "MaxFunEvals", "GradObj",
     "FinDiffType", "TypicalX", "AutoScaling".

     If "GradObj" is "on", it specifies that FCN, when called with 2
     output arguments, also returns the Jacobian matrix of partial first
     derivatives at the requested point.  'TolX' specifies the
     termination tolerance for the unknown variables X, while 'TolFun'
     is a tolerance for the objective function value FVAL.  The default
     is '1e-7' for both options.

     For a description of the other options, see 'optimset'.

     On return, X is the location of the minimum and FVAL contains the
     value of the objective function at X.

     INFO may be one of the following values:

     1
          Converged to a solution point.  Relative gradient error is
          less than specified by 'TolFun'.

     2
          Last relative step size was less than 'TolX'.

     3
          Last relative change in function value was less than 'TolFun'.

     0
          Iteration limit exceeded--either maximum number of algorithm
          iterations 'MaxIter' or maximum number of function evaluations
          'MaxFunEvals'.

     -1
          Algorithm terminated by 'OutputFcn'.

     -3
          The trust region radius became excessively small.

     Optionally, 'fminunc' can return a structure with convergence
     statistics (OUTPUT), the output gradient (GRAD) at the solution X,
     and approximate Hessian (HESS) at the solution X.

     Application Notes: If have only a single nonlinear equation of one
     variable then using 'fminbnd' is usually a better choice.

     The algorithm used by 'fminsearch' is a gradient search which
     depends on the objective function being differentiable.  If the
     function has discontinuities it may be better to use a
     derivative-free algorithm such as 'fminsearch'.

     See also: fminbnd, fminsearch, optimset.
